# Star Wars Script Analysis
Analyzes a Star Wars script using NumPy, Matplotlib and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The goal is to explore character dialogue and word usage throughout the film. This analysis determines how often a character speaks, identifies the top three most active characters, and highlights the most frequently used words after filtering out stopwords.

Key Findings:
- Han Solo had the highest number of speaking lines, followed by Luke and Leia
- After filtering out stopwords, the 20 most frequently used words were identified. The top word spoken was "don't"
- The name "Luke" was among the top 20 most commonly used words, which is expected given his key role in the story
- Character names like "Artoo" and "Chewie" also appeared among the top words, highlighting their memorable presence in the film
